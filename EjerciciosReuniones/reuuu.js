// This task gives you some basic array practice:

// Create an array of three items, and store it in a variable called myArray.
// The items can be anything you want — how about your favorite foods or bands?
// Next, modify the first two items in the array using bracket notation and assignment.
// Finally, add a new item to the beginning of the array.

let myArray = ["hotdog", "sushi", "pizza"];
myArray[0] = "hellou";
myArray[1] = "juguito";

myArray.unshift("loveee");

console.log(myArray);
